### Lab 4 - FER201m - FPT University

> In this assignment, you will continue to work with the website that you have been developing in the exercises. You will edit the home page (index.html), the JavaScript code (scripts.js) and the SCSS code (styles.scss). You will start with the current home page at the end of the last exercise in this module. At the end of this assignment, you should have completed the following tasks:

1. Removed the data-\* attributes from the Reserve Table button and the Login link in the Navbar that control the two modals.
2. Updated the button and the link so that they will trigger the appropriate JavaScript code when clicked.
3. Included appropriate JavaScript code using the modal methods to toggle the showing and hiding of the modals when the two buttons are clicked.
4. Add SCSS code to style the modal with colors.
